# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before installing q2-classo and q2-gglasso, ensure you have:

- QIIME 2 version 2025.4 or later
- Python 3.8 or later

## Installing QIIME 2

If you don't have QIIME 2 installed, follow the official installation guide at [qiime2.org](https://library.qiime2.org/quickstart/amplicon).

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/)
2. Visit the plugin repositories:
   - [q2-gglasso GitHub](https://github.com/bio-datascience/q2-gglasso)
   - [q2-classo GitHub](https://github.com/bio-datascience/q2-classo-latest)
3. Review the documentation:
   - [gglasso documentation](https://gglasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
   - [classo documentation](https://c-lasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)

## Next Steps

Once installation is complete, proceed to the installation of q2-gglasso and q2-classo. Both plugins are independent from each other, so you can install each one of them separately if you only want to do network analysis (q2-gglasso) or classification/regression tasks (q2-classo).
