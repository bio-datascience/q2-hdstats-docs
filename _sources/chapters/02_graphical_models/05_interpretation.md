# Network Interpretation and Analysis

## Overview

This chapter explains how to interpret the results from previous chapters and different graphical lasso methods implemented in q2-gglasso. We'll compare three key approaches: Single Graphical Lasso (SGL), Sparse + Low-Rank (SLR), and Adaptive Graphical Lasso.

## Key Findings 

- **Environmental mediation**: Some apparent microbial correlations are mediated by environmental factors (elevation, pH, soil humidity, temperature)
- **Direct interactions**: Genuine microbial associations remain significant after controlling for environmental variables
- **Latent structure**: The low-rank component captures systematic variation potentially from unmeasured factors or global environmental gradients

### Interpretation guidelines:
- Compare SGL vs. SLR to distinguish direct from latent-mediated associations.
- Use adaptive results to identify environment-independent microbial interactions.
- Consider edge weights and stability across different Î» values for robust associations.

### When to Use Each Method
| Method | Use When | Key Benefits |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **SGL** | Exploratory analysis<br> No environmental data<br> Comprehensive associations<br> Speed priority | Fast, complete network view |
| **SLR** | Suspected confounders<br> Separate direct/indirect effects<br> Batch effects present<br> Core interactions focus | Isolates direct associations |
| **Adaptive model** | Environmental data available<br> Prior knowledge exists<br> Environment-independent focus<br> Hypothesis-driven analysis | Uses prior knowledge, controls confounders |

## Next Steps

Once network associations are identified, use **q2-classo** for regression and classification tasks:

1. **Feature selection**: Use identified microbial associations as candidate features for environmental or phenotype prediction
2. **Regression analysis**: Model continuous outcomes with sparse microbial predictorss
3. **Classification tasks**: Predict binary outcome using selected microbial features
4. **Model selection**: Validate predictive performance using classo's built-in model selection methods
